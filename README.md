Single Second Chess Bot
This repository contains a basic chess bot designed for the Single Second Chess competition. The bot evaluates chess positions and selects the best move within computational constraints, focusing on efficiency and simplicity.

Features
Input: Accepts chess positions in Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN).
Output: Outputs the best move in Universal Chess Interface (UCI) format.
Evaluation: Uses a material-based evaluation heuristic for move selection.
Constraints: Designed to operate efficiently under strict instruction limits.
How It Works
Input: The bot reads a FEN string that describes the current chessboard state from standard input.
Processing:
The chessboard state is initialized using the python-chess library.
All legal moves are evaluated using a simple material-based scoring system.
The bot selects the move with the highest evaluation score.
Output: The selected move is printed in UCI format (e.g., e2e4).
Prerequisites
System Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
python-chess library
Install Dependencies
To install the required library, use:

bash
Copy code
pip install python-chess
Usage
Running the Bot
Save the bot code in a file named single_second_chess.py.
Use the command line to provide a FEN string as input and receive the bot's move as output.
Example Command:
bash
Copy code
echo "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1" | python single_second_chess.py
Example Output:
plaintext
Copy code
e2e4
Code Overview
Key Functions
evaluate_board(board):

Calculates a material score for the board based on piece values.
Favors the current player's position.
get_best_move(fen):

Iterates through all legal moves, evaluates them using evaluate_board, and selects the best move.
main():

Reads the FEN input, computes the best move, and outputs the result in UCI format.

Example Walkthrough
Input:

bash
Copy code
rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1
This FEN string represents the starting position of a chess game.
Processing:

The bot evaluates all possible moves and selects the best one based on material balance.
Output:

Copy code
e2e4
Customization
Improve evaluate_board:
Incorporate positional advantages, mobility, and king safety into the scoring function.
Add advanced algorithms like Minimax or Alpha-Beta Pruning to explore moves deeper into the game tree.
Profile and optimize for computational efficiency to meet strict constraints.
Limitations
The bot uses a greedy approach, evaluating only one move ahead.
Advanced strategies and deeper evaluations require optimizations to fit within the instruction budget.
Future Enhancements
Performance:
Optimize the evaluation function for speed.
Implement iterative deepening to balance performance and depth.
Advanced AI:
Add heuristics like pawn structure evaluation and control of the center.
Integrate game databases for common openings and endgames.
